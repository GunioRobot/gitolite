# easy install for gitolite

# you run this on the client side, and it takes care of all the server side
# work.  You don't have to do anything on the server side directly

# to do a manual install (since I have tested this only on Linux), open this
# script in a nice, syntax coloring, text editor and follow the instructions
# prefixed by the word "MANUAL" in the comments below :-)

# run without any arguments for "usage" info

# important setting: bail on any errors (else we have to check every single
# command!)

Usage: $0 user host port admin_name
  - "user" is the username on the server where you will be installing gitolite
  - "host" is that server's hostname (or IP address is also fine)
  - "port" is optional
  - "admin_name" is *your* name as you want it to appear in the eventual
    gitolite config file

Example usage: $0 git my.git.server sitaram

Output:
  - a proper gitolite admin repo in $HOME/gitolite-admin

Notes:
  - "user" and "admin_name" must be simple names -- no special characters etc
    please (only alphanumerics, dot, hyphen, underscore)
  - traditionally, the "user" is "git", but it can be anything you want
  - "admin_name" should be your name, for clarity, or whoever will be the
    gitolite admin

Pre-requisites:
  - you must run this from the gitolite working tree top level directory.
    This means you run this as "src/00-easy-install.sh"
  - you must already have pubkey based access to user@host.  If you currently
    only have password access, use "ssh-copy-id" or something.  Somehow get to
    the point where you can type "ssh user@host" and get a command line.  Run
    this program only after that is done

Errors:
  - if you get a "pubkey [...filename...] exists" error, it is either leftover
    from a previous, failed, run, or a genuine file you need.  Decide which it
    is, and remove it and retry, or use a different "admin_name", respectively.
